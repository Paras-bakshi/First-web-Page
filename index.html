<h1>Programming languages around us </h1>
</br>
<h1>1. C</h1>
<p>You cannot be a programmer without knowing C or C++.  This is a powerful statement, but I am saying this from my experience. Software engineers or developers who know C are simply better than programmers who don't know C, and it cannot be just plain coincident.
</p>
<h1>2. JAVA</h1>
<p>Java is one of the most popular languages of the last two decades and rules the world of server-side application development. It also holds a sizable market share in mobile games and application development using Android and enterprise web development world.</p>
<h1> 3. PYTHON</h1>
<p>Python is one of the most taught languages in schools and colleges across the world. In the USA, Python has replaced Java from many academic courses as a preferred language to start with. What will you gain by learning Python? A lot.Python is one of that language which can be used as a scripting language as well as a proper object-oriented language for a large project.
</p>
<h1>4. C++</h1>
<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language.C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same.
